                backend, your privacy will be updated. Note that this will not hide your profile
                from other players, but it will prevent RaidHub from displaying your activity
                history and stats. It will also remove you from any individual leaderboards, and
                when logged in, your stats will appear as "unranked" on your profile.

                <p>
                    The leaderboard tiers are based on your position in relation to all players in
                    RaidHub's database. Each tier is broken into 5 even sized segments, I through V.
                    I is the best, while V is the lowest. The tiers are as follows:

        question: "Why are my fresh clears different than on raid.report?",
        answer: (
            <p>
                During Beyond Light, the Bungie API was broken and did return information to
                determine if a raid was a fresh clear or not. As such, we deferred to marking all
                raids as checkpoint clears by default. Raid.report went the opposite route and
                marked all raids as fresh clears by default.
            </p>
        )
    },
    {
        question: "What are the Diamonds on my lowman tags?",
        answer: (
            <p>
                Tags marked with diamonds represent the highest achievable variant of a lowman based
                onthe raid version, flawless status, and fresh vs. checkpoint.
            </p>
        )
    },
    {
        question: "What does RIIS stand for?",
        answer: (
            <p>
                <strong>RIIS</strong> stands for <em>RaidHub Individual Impact Score</em>. It is
                calculated by a formula which takes into account various factors such as your K+A/D
                and time spent in the raid. Players on a PGCR page are sorted by their RIIS
